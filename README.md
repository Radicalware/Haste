# Haste

This will continue to develop over time
to give you a collection of useful
scripts so you will have the Haste you need!

-------------------------------------------

## Linux

$> alsr
used to alert you to your ASLR configuration and allows you to easily change it when need be.

$> ifs = Internal File Search
It will scan the contents inside your files to find the content you are looking for.

$> ff = Find File
faster to use "ff <filename>" instead of
find ./ -name 'filename' -type f

$> cg = color grep
This will print out all of the content (instead of just what you are grepping for) and will make what you are grepping for in color red (good when you need the big picture).

## Windows

$> ff.ps1 = Find File
Used to scan for a filename from your current dir
similar to "find ./ -name 'argv[1]'"
