# Haste

This will continue to develop over time
to give you a collection of useful
scripts so you will have the Haste you need!

-------------------------------------------

## MultiPlatform


$> f = Find File
Used to scan for a filename from your current dir
It uses multi-threading to get the job done faster!
similar to "find ./ -name 'argv[1]'"

$> afs = advanced file search
This will recursivly search your files for text with multithreading

## Windows

$> l = Windows version of ls
This has the added benefit of also sorting your columns from smallest to largest.
This means you will have less whitespace and fewer columns due to more space being used up.
It means you can see more files/folders and do less scrolling. 
Also, it seperates you files from folders and color-codes them for easy viewing.
The default is sorting alphabetically (same as ls on linux)

## Nix (Linux/OSX)

$> ifs = Internal File Search
It will scan the contents inside your files to find the content you are looking for.

$> cg = color grep
This will print out all of the content (instead of just what you are grepping for) and will make what you are grepping for in color red (good when you need the big picture).

## Linux

$> alsr
used to alert you to your ASLR configuration and allows you to easily change it when need be.
